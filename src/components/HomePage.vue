      <h3>Hello world!</h3>
      <p>
        This is a site for discovering what open source work developers are doing in the Greater St. Louis region by
        harvesting public information from Github.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a user on Github has self-identified as being from St. Louis, they are included here. To do this, add
        <code>St. Louis</code> to your location in your Github profile.
      </p>

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <p>
        There are over 3,000 developers from St. Louis on Github that have pushed to over 6,000 code repositories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creator of the sublime-text git plugin is from St. Louis. Another St. Louisan created a JavaScript CMS and
        yet another made a Dropbox-like sync tool in pure shell script!
      </p>
      <p>
        We have many talented and driven developers here and this site's goal is to show off our projects to the city
        and the rest of the world.
      </p>
